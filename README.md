# 🚀 Types of Social Media: Interactive Learning & Quiz App

**Live Demo:** [https://types-of-social-media.vercel.app/](https://types-of-social-media.vercel.app/)

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project is a modern, interactive web application designed to educate users on the different **Types of Social Media Platforms**. It serves as both a high-quality learning resource and a practical demonstration of using AI to rapidly generate complex, high-quality front-end features.

The application follows a clear pedagogical structure:
1.  **Visual Concept Presentation:** A dynamic, clean interface to introduce and define the various social media categories.
2.  **Reinforcement Quiz:** An interactive quiz module to test and reinforce the user's understanding of the concepts.

### 💡 Key Insight & Technical Focus

This application showcases the power of **Applied AI in front-end development**. The complex circular navigation and seamless transition logic were primarily generated by an LLM (Large Language Model) using strategic prompting. The focus was shifted from writing tedious CSS/JS syntax to **architecting the feature**, allowing the developer to concentrate 90% of their energy on **instructional design and content clarity**.

## ✨ Features

* **Interactive Learning Flow:** Clear, structured progression from conceptual learning to quiz-based assessment.
* **Custom Circular Navigation:** A unique, engaging CSS-driven menu for platform selection.
* **Real-Time Assessment:** Quiz logic provides immediate feedback and score updates.
* **Mobile-First Design:** Fully responsive layout ensuring accessibility on both desktop and mobile devices.
* **Clean, Maintainable Codebase:** Demonstrates the result of using AI as a "Feature Architect" to generate semantic and modular code.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom), JavaScript (Vanilla)
* **Hosting:** Vercel (or any standard web server)

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
* Node.js (for potential future tooling or local server setup, though not strictly required for this basic structure).

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/chanchalbohra14/types-of-social-media.git](https://github.com/chanchalbohra14/types-of-social-media.git)
cd types-of-social-media

2. Run Locally
Since this is a primarily static HTML/CSS/JS application, you can view it directly in your browser:

Open the project directory.

Double-click the index.html file.

Alternatively, you can use a simple local server extension (like Live Server for VS Code) for easier development:

Right-click on index.html.

Select "Open with Live Server" (if installed).

Built with the assistance of an LLM as a high-speed development partner.
